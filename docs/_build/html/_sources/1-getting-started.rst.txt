Purpose of this plugin
----------------------

The *Gradle Changelog Automation Plugin* has one purpose: **to automate your CHANGELOG.md generation**.

The plugin addresses the following problems:

* frequent merge conflicts in your changelog file
   * even with only 2 developers, merge conflicts are very likely to happen
* manual updates
   * any time you make a release, you have to be sure that you also manually update your changelog file
* human errors
   * due to the manual maintenance, it might happen that you simply forget to update your changelog or just simply make a mistake


Followed conventions
---------------------

The plugin is based on `Keep a Changelog <https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/>`_. Any generated `CHANGELOG.md` file will follow this convention.

Furthermore, the plugin expects that you follow `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html>`_.
