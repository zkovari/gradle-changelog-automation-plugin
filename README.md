# Gradle Changelog Automation Plugin

Inspired by [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/): [https://about.gitlab.com/2018/07/03/solving-gitlabs-changelog-conflict-crisis/](https://about.gitlab.com/2018/07/03/solving-gitlabs-changelog-conflict-crisis/)

# What does this plugin do

This plugin is able to generate `CHANGELOG.md` from YAML files.
One YAML file represents one unreleased changelog entry.
For example, a new added feature's entry would look like this:

```yaml
title: My new feature
reference: GH-1
author: John Doe
type: added
```

Then the plugin can process the unreleased YAML entries and combine them into `CHANGELOG.md`.
The changelog is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

As an example, see this project's changelog which is automatically generated by this plugin:
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

# Getting started

## How to apply the plugin

Using the [plugins DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugins_block):

```gradle
plugins {
    id 'org.zkovari.changelog' version '0.2.2'
}
```

Or using legacy [plugin application](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:old_plugin_application):

```gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.zkovari.changelog:changelog-automation-gradle-plugin:0.2.2'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'org.zkovari.changelog'
```

## How to generate YAML entries

The plugin contains a generator script that you can fetch with the `fetchChangelogScript` task:

```bash
gradle fetchChangelogScript
# result: scripts/changelog.sh

# add permission
chmod +x scripts/changelog.sh
```

To generate a new unreleased changelog entry (YAML), run `changelog.sh`:

```bash
./scripts/changelog.sh --type added "My new feature"
```

As a result, a new changelog entry is generated under `changelogs/unreleased`,
in this case the following one:

```yaml
title: My new feature
reference:
author:
type: added
```

See `changelog.sh --help` or the [detailed documentation](https://gradle-changelog-automation-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2-user-guide.html#how-to-generate-unreleased-changelog-entries-yaml-files) for further information.

## How to process unreleased changelog entries

If you already have unreleased YAML entries under `changelogs/unreleased`, you can combine them into your `CHANGELOG.md` with the task `processChangelogEntries`:

```bash
gradle processChangelogEntries
```

As a result, your `CHANGELOG.md` is updated with a new release entry.
As an exmaple, see this project's changelog which is automatically generated by this plugin: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

The task `processChangelogEntries` also removes your unreleased entries from `changelogs/unreleased`.
